# House-Price-Prediction

We will be doing all our programming in python and for this House price prediction system we will be using a xg boost regression algorithm  as well as linear regression algorithm
because this house price prediction is a regression problem in supervised learning. We will train our machine learning model with data set of one of the places that user will provide us from the GUI.

PLACES ïƒ¨  Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai , Kolkata .  

First we import all the dependencies ie all the required libraries. then we will train  our model using the choosen  data set with 
The help of two Models
 
1)	XGB Regressor 
2)	 Linear Regressor

and we will get  two different prediction values one with higher accuracy then others and  we  will set the values int the form of range in our GUI  and  this result has been set in the web page(GUI)  with  the help of render templates ,flask ,html and Css.
